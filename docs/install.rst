Installation
============
It is advised to use **pip** for installation, Please make sure
**the latest version** is installed since PyOD is currently updated
on **a daily basis**:

At the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyod
    pip install --upgrade pyod  # make sure the latest version is installed!

or

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyod==x.y.z  # (x.y.z) is the current version number

Alternatively, downloading/cloning the `Github repository <https://github.com/yzhao062/Pyod/>`_ also works.
You could unzip the files and execute the following command in the folder where the files get decompressed.
