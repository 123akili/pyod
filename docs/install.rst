============
Installation
============
It is advised to use **pip** to install the latest version:

At the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyod
    pip install --upgrade pyod

or

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyod==x.y.z

Please check the version number(x.y.z) is consistent with the current version number. Pypi can be unstable sometimes.
Alternatively, downloading/cloning the `Github repository <https://github.com/yzhao062/Pyod/>`_ also works.
You could unzip the files and execute the following command in the folder where the files get decompressed.
